    <p> I bought this product because people on Tiktok have been talking about how good this product smells. Some 
        have even talked about how it smells similar to the Baccarat Rouge 540 perfume and that happens to be my 
        all time favorite perfume. Once I tried this body cream, I was super impressed with how good it smells and I got 
        so many compliments from strangers saying that I smell really good! I also got asked by random people what perfume I 
        was wearing when it was all just this cream. This cream was also intensely moisturizing and gave my skin a good glow. I 
        would give this product a solid 10/10!  </p></td>

        <td><h2> <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/P421275">Peace Out Salicylic Acid Healing Dots </a> </h2>
    <p> I bought this product to try and see if it did anything for my pesky acne spots and I can say that it really did help them to 
        disappear. I really liked how easy they were to apply, but they were quite expensive for what they are. I would actually skip out on 
        buying these and instead buy the ones on Amazon where you could get so many more stickers for a much lower price. </p></td>

    <p> I have been testing out this face cream for about 3 days and I can say it is a little too heavy for my liking. As a background, I have 
        quite oily skin so this made me feel quite gross throughout the day. I ended up giving it away to my friend who swears by this product, but sha 
        likes it because she has very very dry skin. </p></td>

        <td><h2> <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/P442956">Natasha Denona Contour Sculpting Powder </a>  </h2>
    <p> I love contour powders and I decided to try this one out. I love the shade of this contour powder because it is perfectly
        grey toned which makes it look like a very realistic shadow. It can however, be a little bit hard to blend out so you have to 
        make sure to powder the skin beforehand to ensure a seamless blend. </p></td>

    <p> I picked up this lip oil because of the hype I see on TikTok. I tried it a few times and it really gives you that glossy, juicy,
        plump lip look. It does not last very long however, and my hair gets stuck on my lips quite often if I use this. It does not necessarily 
        make my lips a lot more hydrated, so I would give this a 6/10. </p></td>
